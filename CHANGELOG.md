# Changelog

What changed for whoever runs `lectiod`, calls its API, or builds on the
packages, one section per release. A `v*` tag without a section here is
refused before it is pushed.

## Unreleased

- Added: the durable task store over Postgres, as a package
  (`internal/store/postgres`) the server does not open yet. A parse and
  its tasks are rows; a worker reaches the database through one
  statement that renews its lease, settles, and claims the next tasks
  in the fair order of tenants, projects and classes, only where a
  reader has room. `lectiod` still runs with `LECTIO_DEV=true` alone.
- Added: `LECTIO_DATABASE_POOL_URL`, the endpoint the store's pool
  opens, for an installation with a transaction-mode pooler in front of
  its database. Without it the pool opens `LECTIO_DATABASE_URL`, which
  migrations always use.
- Added: the repository scaffold. The object model (`document`); the
  interfaces a page-reading model and a field-extracting model sit behind
  (`reader`), with adapters for an OpenAI-compatible chat endpoint, for a
  layout engine behind HTTP, and a stub that calls nothing; intake for
  images, text, Markdown and CSV; assembly with Markdown, text and chunk
  views chosen when a result is read; and the HTTP contract in
  `api/openapi.yaml`.
- Added: `lectiod` with `LECTIO_DEV=true`, a development server that
  serves the whole contract in one process and keeps nothing. Routes the
  contract marks planned answer `501 not_implemented`.
- Added: PDF pages are rendered in process, by PDFium compiled to
  WebAssembly: no C library, no second service. The engine sees no host
  file and is bounded in memory and time.
- Added: `GET /parses/{parse}/blocks`, every block of the pages read so
  far in one answer.
- Added: a parse that is canceled, runs out of time, or loses pages
  still serves its document. A page it never read has the state
  `skipped`.
- Added: on a block, `description`, what a reader says a figure shows,
  kept apart from `text`; on a table cell, `header`; on a page,
  `truncated` and `reused`; on a reader, `version`.
- Changed: `reuse` works by page. Every submit makes a parse of its own;
  a page already read whole from the same bytes by the same readers is
  taken and no model is called. A parse no longer answers with another
  parse and `reused: true`; it reports `progress.pages_reused`.
- Changed: a chat reader sends no `temperature` unless one is
  configured, and sends its output bound as `max_completion_tokens`
  unless `outputLimitParam: max_tokens` is set.
- Added: a Reader document takes `boxes` (the order and space a model is
  asked for positions in), `temperature`, `outputLimitParam` and `cost`.
  `requestsPerMinute` is refused.
- Changed: `priority` orders a caller's own pages. Callers take turns,
  and nothing one queues moves it ahead of another.
- Added: `make live`, an opt-in test that parses a real file with a
  configured reader.
- Security: a source URL reaches no trace; a table's markup is written
  from its cells and never passed through from a model; a page is
  skipped as blank only when every pixel is one color. `SECURITY.md`
  lists each control with its test and what is not promised.
- Added: `GET /parses/{parse}/blocks/{ref}/image`, a block as it looks
  on its page: the page image cut to the block's box.
- Added: `POST` and `GET /parses/{parse}/figures`. A request against a
  parse that has ended has each figure cut from its page and described
  by a model: the block gains `description`, `figure.type`, and the
  words printed in the figure. No page is read again, and a figure
  described once is not described twice.
- Added: the Policy document takes `describe.chain`, naming the Reader
  documents that describe figures. A `chat` reader can; a `layout`
  reader cannot.
- Added: `make live` with `LECTIO_LIVE_DESCRIBE=1` also describes the
  figures of the file it parses.
- Changed: every operation's `summary` in `api/openapi.yaml` is a short
  label with no closing period, and the sentence it replaced opens the
  operation's description, so a reference renders the document as it is.
